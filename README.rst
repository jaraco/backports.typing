backports.typing
================

`Backport <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/backports>`_ of the typing module
as found in Python 3.5, but made available for Python 3.3 and later.

Since the inception of this package, a new, more authoritative backport
has been released as `typing <https://pypi.io/project/typing>`_. This
project selectively installs that package on the relevant platforms.

Usage
-----

Simply import the typing module as you would on Python 3.5+.

    import typing
